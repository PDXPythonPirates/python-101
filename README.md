# PDX Python Pyrates Introductory Python Course

## Introduction

There exists a plethora of free, high-quality resources on the internet to learn Python. But with so many it is difficult to know where to begin and focus one’s time and energy. This syllabus was created to solve that problem: providing everyone with a starting point to learn Python using these great resources.

This syllabus is largely based on [Mike Dane’s](https://www.mikedane.com) video course [Python Introduction](https://www.mikedane.com/programming-languages/python/). This syllabus breaks up that course into material that is designed to be covered in 10 weeks. In addition to the video lectures, this syllabus augments what Mike covers with:

* Recommended reading from books like [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) by Allen B. Downey and [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart. These are amazing, free resources to help you along your coding journey.
* Exercises (with solutions) that have been coded up by Bryan and others that are hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com/). 
* Additional resources (videos, articles, exercise, and code challenges) from across the internet.
  * Kylie Ying's [12 Beginner Python Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg)
  * Patrick Loeber’s [Advanced Python Programming Course](https://www.python-engineer.com/courses/advancedpython/)
