# Python 101

Welcome to the text companion to the [Python Pyrates](https://www.pythonpyrates.org) introductory Python course.

The internet contains plenty of high-quality resources to learn Python. Some are free, some are behind paywalls. With so many available it can be difficult to know where to begin one's learning journey and focus their time and energy. As Pyrates, we're dedicated to making learning Python accessible to everyone. Our hope is this book is the _best free resource_ for learning Python.
