    "\n",
    "Using code to get a computer to talk back to you is [typically the first thing you'll learn](https://www.thesoftwareguild.com/blog/the-history-of-hello-world/) when studying a programming language. Not only is it typically a simple task, and therefore perfect for newcomers, but learning this skill allows for an easy introduction to core coding concepts such as functions, data types, variables, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following in the footsteps of others, the first programming concept we'll cover is printing output to the user. This ability is useful for several reasons, which we'll cover in the examples throughout this introductory section. Since Python uses a function to print output, we'll also introduce functions and arguments along the way.\n",

It is a piece of code that performs a specific task, and it will perform that task only when you tell it to do so. (Much like a hammer to a carpenter.) In Python we use, or _call_, a function by typing it's name followed by open and closed parentheses. For example,"

It is also helpful to you, as a programmer, when you are debugging and testing your code (which we'll cover in a later lesson). Python makes printing output easy with the `print()` function. It works intuitively, outputting whatever you pass it, even if you pass it multiple arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we explored `print()`'s capabilities, we introduced the concept of functions, which are blocks of code that are standing by to perform a specific task for you. We pass functions arguments, which can take the shape of an on-the-fly value (e.g., `print('Hello World!')`), or some variable we've defined. `print()` handles arguments from all sorts of data types, not just strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print()` function doesn't require that an argument be passed, but it is more helpful when at least one is. And it has pre-defined keyword arguments called `sep` and `end` which can be modified to change how the values of arguments are separated and how the output ends, respectively.\n",
